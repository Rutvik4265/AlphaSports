            <p class="card-text">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to
                score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most
                popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as
                soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
                Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic
                football.[1][2] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as
                football codes.

                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                different parts of the world.[3][4][5] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[6][7] The expansion and
                cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
                influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional
                codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of
                local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League
                was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th
                century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in
                the world.[10]</p>
