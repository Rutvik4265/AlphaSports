            <h5 class="card-title">Wrestling</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling-type techniques such as clinch
                fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. The sport can either be
                genuinely competitive or sportive entertainment (see professional wrestling). Wrestling comes in
                different types[1] such as folkstyle, freestyle, Greco-Roman, catch/submission, judo, sambo and others.
                A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring
                partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with
                varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been
                incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.Wrestling
                represents one of the oldest forms of combat. The origins of wrestling go back 15,000 years through cave
                drawings. Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using most of the holds known in the
                present-day sport. Literary references to it occur as early as the Old Testament and the ancient Indian
                Vedas. In the Book of Genesis, the Patriarch Jacob is said to have wrestled with God or an angel.[3] The
                Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC, also contains mentions of
                wrestling.[4] Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata contain references to martial arts including
                wrestling. In ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend and literature; wrestling
                competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games. The ancient
                Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality.

                During the Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century) wrestling remained popular and enjoyed the
                patronage of many royal families, including those of France, Japan and England.

                Early British settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them. The settlers also
                found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans.[5] Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the
                early years of the North American colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday
                celebrations, and in military exercises. The first organized national wrestling tournament took place in
                New York City in 1888. Wrestling has also been an event at every modern Olympic Games since the 1904
                games in St. Louis, Missouri (a demonstration had been performed at the first modern Olympics). The
                international governing body for the sport, United World Wrestling (UWW), was established in 1912 in
                Antwerp, Belgium as the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA). The 1st NCAA
                Wrestling Championships were also held in 1912, in Ames, Iowa. USA Wrestling, located in Colorado
                Springs, Colorado, became the national governing body of U.S. amateur wrestling in 1983.

                By country
                In Pharaonic Egypt, wrestling has been evidenced by documentation on tombs (circa 2300 BC) and Egyptian
                artwork (2000-1085 BC).
                Greek wrestling was a popular form of martial art, at least in Ancient Greece (about 1100 to 146 BC).[6]
                Oil wrestling is the national sport of Turkey and it can be traced back to Central Asia.
                After the Roman conquest of the Greeks, Greek wrestling was absorbed by the Roman culture and became
                Roman wrestling during the period of the Roman Empire (510 BC to AD 500).[citation needed]
                Shuai jiao, a wrestling style originating in China, which according to legend, has a reported history of
                over 4,000 years.
                Arabic literature depicted Muhammad as a skilled wrestler, defeating a skeptic in a match at one point.
                The Byzantine emperor Basil I, according to court historians, won in wrestling against a boastful
                wrestler from Bulgaria in the eighth century.[7]
                In 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold pageant, Francis I of France threw fellow king Henry VIII of
                England in a wrestling match.[7]
                The Lancashire style of folk wrestling may have formed the basis for Catch wrestling, also known as
                "catch as catch can." The Scots later formed a variant of this style, and the Irish developed the
                "collar-and-elbow" style which later found its way into the United States.[8]
                A Frenchman[n 1] "is generally credited with reorganizing European loose wrestling into a professional
                sport", Greco-Roman wrestling.[9] This style which was finalized by the 19th century and by then,
                wrestling was featured in many fairs and festivals in Europe.[10]
                Greco-Roman wrestling and contemporary freestyle wrestling were soon regulated in formal competitions,
                in part resulting from the rise of gymnasiums and athletic clubs.
                On continental Europe, prize money was offered in large sums to the winners of Greco-Roman tournaments,
                and freestyle wrestling spread rapidly in the United Kingdom and in the United States after the American
                Civil War. Wrestling professionals soon increased the popularity of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling,
                worldwide.[8][11]
                Greco-Roman wrestling became an event at the first modern Olympic games, in Athens in 1896. Since 1908,
                the event has been in every Summer Olympics.
                Freestyle wrestling became an Olympic event, in 1904. Women's freestyle wrestling was added to the
                Summer Olympics in 2004.
                Since 1921, United World Wrestling (UWW) has regulated amateur wrestling as an athletic discipline,
                while professional wrestling has largely become infused with theatrics but still requires athletic
                ability. Today, various countries send national wrestling teams to the Olympics, including Russia, Iran,
                Turkey, Mongolia, Azerbaijan, Japan, South Korea, Gambia, the United States and several ex-U.S.S.R.
                nations.
                In Switzerland the local derivate of the German ringen, called schwingen, is a popular folk sport with
                local Schwingfest where regional competitions are played throughout the country.
